							<h2>Xiangshan 象山</h2>
							<p>Elephant Mountain</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p> The best time to hike the mountain is during late afternoon, this way you can catch the sunset as well as a daytime view and stunning nighttime view of the city, however the trail can get relatively crowded during the weekend.

The hike takes a total of around 15-20 minutes to the top, and includes lots of stairs! Remember to take a left at the fork in the path. After around 8-10 minutes, there will be a landing area with facilities and restrooms where the path branches off in multiple directions.

</p>
							<p>From Taipei 101:
From the base of Taipei 101, walk east on Xinyi Road (信義路) for two blocks until you reach MRT Xiangshan Station, only a 15 minute walk from 101 and completely worth it. To get there faster, take a YouBike from the station across the street from 101 (MRT Exit 2), then return the bike at the park nearby the trail entrance.

								<h3>Wuji Tianyuan Temple 淡水天元宮</h3>
								<p>Was really lucky to be able to still catch the cherry blossoms in mid April! I visited the temple and vicinity at around 3pm+ on a weekday afternoon....I would say the visitor traffic is moderate... with some efforts and patience, it was still possible to take a picture without being photobombed by other visitors....

Took some flights of stairs up the temple to enjoy that peaceful and breathtaking view of the surroundings from the top!</p>

								<h3>Chang Kai-shek Memorial Hall<p>中正紀念堂</p></h3>
								<p> I am in awe when I saw this vast complex. I am not expecting this especially just around the main city and it's free entrance!
The main hall is an interesting architectural piece. Inside and out, from top to bottom - it's really amazing. It housed the big statue of Chiang Kai Shek and there's an hourly ceremony for the changing of guards. You can go there to get a good spot to view the ceremony because it can be too crowded sometimes.</p>

								<h3>Dahu Park  大湖公園</h3>
								<p>I have been to Dahu Park several times. The last time I went there was to go fishing ! :o) Catch and release (you definitely don't want to eat those fish...yuck !) The park is a relaxing place to bring the kids...there is a lake in the middle of the whole place, bathrooms,...parking around the edge...</p>
